        <p class="lead mb-4">I am currently a first year student attending the University of California, Riverside majoring in Business Economics. I received my high school diploma at Walnut High School in the year of 2019 at the end of May. I plan on getting a degree in my current major which is Business Economics and to possibly pursue in the medical field. I plan to apply to medical school after graduating university in the year 2023. Although I do not have any job experience in business economics, I plan to intern in the field later on during college to gain more experience for the future. Since I am still a first year, I plan on applying for internships starting next summer going into my third year. I believe that interning for a company related to my major will help me a lot in the future so I can further understand my major and the different varieties of jobs I can do in the future with my business economics degree.<br><br>

        Since applying to medical school is still something I plan to do after graduating college, although I am still not 100% sure, I would like to look into internship programs in the medical field as well to gain experience and fulfill my clinical time required before applying to medical school. If I do not end up applying for medical school I plan to continue my degree in Business Economics. However, currently I am just trying to finish all my lower division requirements in my major to hopefully start my upper division classes junior year of college. With the economics courses I have been taking so far in college, I have been enjoying them and the major. Knowing that I have been interested in business economics is helping me to be more eager in learning to get my degree and possibly pursue it in the future.<br><br>

        Before coming to college, although I do not have any job experience related to business economics, I have had many opportunities and jobs during my four years in high school. I did a lot of volunteer work from feeding the homeless to working at city events and packing care bags for those in need. With the club I joined in high school I was able to volunteer a lot and to give back to the community. Besides doing volunteer work, I got the opportunity to do research with a professor in the University of California, San Diego during my summer going into senior year of high school on the topic of greenhouse gases, the causes of its emission, and its effect on climate change. During high school I was given a leadership position in my church to help Youth Group and Children's Church plan events and lessons for them every Sunday. With all the opportunities I got in high school, I was able to learn many new skills, gain leadership, learn how to work with others, experience what my future might be like when I do get a job, and find out things about myself.
